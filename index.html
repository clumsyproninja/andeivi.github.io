                <p>
                    Hey there! My name is <strong>Andeivi Mejia Taveras.</strong>
                    I'm a web developer student at PCCC, and I have a passion for gaming and computers. 
                    I have proficient experience with Java, Python, C++, and currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.
                    I'm always looking for new things to learn, adapting quickly, and refining my versatility skills.
                    <br><br>
                    I have some amazing Python projects that I've been working on, and I'd love to showcase them to you.
                    Additionally, I have another page about my own custom PC that I built. 
                    I've been maintaining it and constantly upgrading it since the beginning.
                    As a result, I have acquired extensive knowledge about PC hardware components.
                    <br><br>
                    When I start a big project, I love making things fun and interactive.
                    And I'm really excited to share this passion-filled website with you.
                    So let's dive in and have some fun!
